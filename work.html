            <p>On this page you can find links to my previous pieces of work. This includes my A level project which was a randomly generated maze, with a chaser enemy using an A-star algorithm to hunt you down.
                You will also be able to find a copy of my CV which has additional contact information on and finally there is a copy on a LSEPI essay I wrote about the issues surrounding an AR mapping system.

                <h3>A level project</h3>
                <br>
                <p>In my A level project I decided to create a randomly generated maze, using a 2D array with each entry representing either a wall, door, or free space. This allowed me to apply a path-finding algorithm
                    to it. I chose to use A-star as unlike Dijkstra's it can use heuristics to run much quicker, and allows for some variance in how the enemy behaves, as it may not always take the exact best route to you
                    but still gets to you quickly. The program is written in python and uses the pygame library.
