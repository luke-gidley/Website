        <h3>Education</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I have spent the last 5 years doing computer science, first at GCSE where I got a B, then again at A level, once again getting a B but with my project getting an A. This has helped grow my interest for computer science
            as it has allowed me to properly learn about a subject that started as a hobby. This knowledge also lets me work on my own projects, including the extension of my A level project.
            <br><br><br><br>
            At my secondary school I spent time helping run open days for my department, along with helping run a STEM day for year 7's. On this STEM day I was in charge of robot maintenance and was a coding assistance. As the lead maintenance
            person I learnt how to deal with peoples requests quickly and in a timely matter, while also learning how to effectively help people solve their many coding issues. It also helped with my teamwork skills as we were each given
            a set of groups to assist, while also helping out my fellow organisers.

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I like to spend my spare time in the summer being outside. I normally spend this time out fishing on my local river as I enjoy the calm atmosphere of fishing along with the excitement of catching a fish. I also
            play rugby for my local team occasionally, even though since I have come to university I do not have time to play for them anymore. In the summer I will normally organise a trip to somewhere in the UK to go camping and mountaineering
            with my friends as it allows for a calm get away from everything.
            <br><br>
            I also enjoy spending time playing video games with my friends, mainly playing heavily teamwork or strategy games as these allow me to spend more time talking to my friends. I spend some of this time working on my
            own project, or spend time modding games.
