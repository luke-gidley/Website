            <br>
            <p>On this page you can find information about the charity work that I have participated in. This includes an expedition out to Malawi, in which I helped to build part of a school, 
                along with a long term project at my secondary school in which we make female sanitary products which get sent out to help keep women in education.</p>

            <h3>Kachere School</h3>
            <br>
            <p>On the Malawi expedition we visited a school known as Kachere School. While we were there we participated in the construction of the foundations of a new school building. This involved coordination from
                the team to allow us to work efficiently. We spent the first day cleaning up the whole work site, ordering bricks and throwing out broken ones, to allow the workers to work quicker and not have to move the bricks themselves.
                <br><br>On the second day we moved onto making cement for the foundations, working in teams of 3 to dig up and move sand to then be mixed into the cement. After this we spent time levelling the sand on the foundations, and filled in the sides.

            <h3>Crisis Nursery</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Towards the end of the expedition we went to a crisis nursery to help feed and look after the babies, giving the workers valuable time to relax and have a proper break. Whilst we were there we spent
                the majority of the time playing with the babies and generally helping them. Afterwards we made a donation to the nursery to help make sure they are able to help the orphans as much as possible.

            <h3>Ongoing work</h3>
            <br>
            <p>When we got back from Malawi, as a group we decided to start making sanitary products for the women at the school, as they did not have access to the right products. We needed to get money towards the postage
                so I decided to set up a fundraising night, where we would get members of the school and wider community in to help us raise funds.<br><br>This night was a success as we raised £170, allowing us to send many parcels 
                over to the school. We were also able to get the support of a local business, which over lock 40 of our products a month, allowing them to have a professional finish before they are sent out. This project is still
                ongoing, and I help out whenever I have a chance, which includes sewing to material collection.
